                                    Having just finished a little stint as an enlisted guy in the Army,
                                    I began my Computer Science career in earnest. I had a great job at DHI
                                    Computing Services, where I worked for the best managers ever: Mark Benson, Dave
                                    Harris, Jessie Jarman, etc. They also were some of the most brilliant people I've
                                    ever
                                    known. Then, like losing the ring (from Lord of the Ring) something unexpected
                                    happened. In any case, I felt compelled to relocate to Kansas City to meet the
                                    emergency. What
                                    enabled me to live here is Cerner. They have a great health care
                                    package, and plenty of work--you will never be bored if you work for them, and that
                                    was
                                    great. What I didn't realize when I went to the interview was how small a role
                                    programming would play. So I jumped on the GDIT ship. Again, great people, great
                                    company. So, I have
                                    approximately spent the following years in each skill, respectively: C# 4; Assembly
                                    4; C++ 2; SQL
                                    and Javascript 1.

                            </div>

                        <div class="row p-2">
                            <div class="col-md-12">
                                <p>
                                    I am looking for full time employment. However, it has
                                    been great being a part-time student in the Full Stack course. I love it. The
                                    instructors are seemingly omni-present, as they answer questions at all times of the
                                    day. They are knowledgeable, great communicators, patient, and also efficient, at
                                    the same time.
                                    Anybody who takes this course will be prepared to be a Full Stack developer.
