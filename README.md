# Responsive Portfolio

This is a responsive website that utilizes Bootstrap.  There are three webpages: an About page (the home page), a Contacts page, and a Portfolio page. The About page, or homepage, is about me, in a nutshell.  The Contacts page contains form input boxes that take information from the user.  There's a button (or an anchor made to look like a button) that lets the user submit the info.

Boostrap does support a sticky Navbar, so I utlized that because I like a sticky navbar.  

The home page (About) is basically a large card, consisting of a photo of myself, a title, and two paragraphs telling you a little bit about me.  Utilizing the Bootstrap grid system, the About page starts out with just one row and one column, responsively, with the small screen utilizing the entire screen and the medium and larger screens utilizing 2/3 of the screen.  Within that, I have a heading, and the two paragraphs.  The photo floats left, so the text wraps around the photo.

The Portfolio page consists of 5 cards.  There are four rows nested inside the main row, with a heading row, then two columns for each row. Each cell contains a card, gotten from Bootstrap.  Each card contains a link to something about my portfolio--my LinkedIn profile, and then coding samples, respectively.

The Contact page consists of one main row, with three nested rows.  The nested rows are just one column each, with some sort of form input.  Bootstrap is utilized to make that anchor look like a button, after the three rows.

All three html pages were run through an HTML validator, found by using Google-Fu.
